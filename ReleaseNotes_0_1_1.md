# Release notes #

### Released Syx 0.1.1 version ###

This second version of Syx includes as many bug fixes as feature enhancements.
I wanted to release this version just after 3 days because i think such changes are very important.
  * Implemented linear hash tables, similar to double hash
  * Added method caching to both unary and binary messages
  * Added bdist command to create a binary distribution
  * Improved exception handling and tracebacks
  * Added Integer class with basic bit-wise operations
  * Inline whileFalse: block
  * Covered most of PositionableStream standard
  * Added basic subclassing at runtime
