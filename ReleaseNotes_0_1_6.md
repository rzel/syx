### Released Syx 0.1.6 version ###

  * Basic support for handling foreign C pointers and structs/unions from Smalltalk has been added
  * Several fixes for building on Sparc 64 using SCons
  * The -e option from command line has been added
  * Some help and Syx status will be printed in console mode
  * FileStream fileIn has been fixed
  * Class declaration from Smalltalk has been fixed
  * Lexer fixes for symbols, identifier and strings
  * FileStream now handles `FILE*` instead of file descriptors and this fixed several bugs
  * System startup has been fixed when fileing in files
  * Dictionary rehashing has been fixed
  * Basic support for handling foreign C structs and unions from Smalltalk has been added
